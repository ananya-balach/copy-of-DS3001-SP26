3. Do any of your findings surprise you? ,,,,
"Yes, I find that I imagined that cerrtain scientist jobs would make a lot more, and even though these would likely be entry level salaries, I find it slightly upsetting that something like a six figure job is unattainable for the level of schooling it takes to be a professional in these science-heavy fields.
